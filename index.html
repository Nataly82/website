<h1>Networks: Mobile Business</h1>
   
    <p>The idea of a network allows other devices to communicate important things. Also it will reduce the cost of connecting and particular networks will achieve these goals. Today's business networks include a combination of local area networks, wide area networks, and metropolitan area networks. All these networks are categorized based on geographic spans. </p>

    <p>A <i>local area network</i> connects a group of computers in close proximity such as in an office building, school, or home. <b>LAN</b>'s allow sharing of files, printers, games, and other resources. <b>WAN</b>'s are essential for carrying out the day to day activities of many companies and government organizations. A <i>wide area network</i> spans a large geographic area such as a state, province, or country. A <i>metropolitan area network</i> is a large computer network, usually spanning a city. Most colleges, universites, and large companies that span a campus use an infrasturcture support by a MAN.</p>
